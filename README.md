# facebook-hack-2019
Our solution for Facebook Hackathon Poland 2019

## Development guide
1. To develop the app you need to have a [GCP](cloud.google.com) account and be part of the facebook-hack-2019 project.
2. Before connecting to the database, you will need a ```credentials.py``` file. Ask [@wkulikowski](https://github.com/wkulikowski) about it.
3. Before connecting to the database, you will need to do a SQLproxy setup from this [Instruction](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/quickstart-proxy-test)
4. CI/CD are overrated, so after mergining your branch to master kindly inform [@wkulikowski](https://github.com/wkulikowski) about it :wink:
5. Have fun!
